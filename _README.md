I wish I started this file 5 years ago, but now is better than never. 

## Files

analyses_compmod_exp2 -- compares models with loo

analyses_exp1and2.R -- this code appears to run all the models, including those used in plotting_exp2_mergedmodels.R

plotting_exp2.R -- this code appears to plot the random slope models

plotting_exp2_mergedmodels.R -- this makes muploteachspeciesalone_wavgpost.pdf and other figures we're using as of today.
